This dataset consists of system logs from a Linux Redhat 7.1 system deployed in a honeynet.  The owner of the data runs a site for public domain, real-world log data in which malicious activities are captured.  One interesting aspect of this data is that there is no sanitization or anonymization; the data is provided unmodified (and no modifications are needed or required to use the data for research).
